BANKS vs BLOCKCHAINS

in banks after the username and password signin we can 
1. see balance
2. transfer money
3. recieve money

in blockchains if we want to create a wallet:
"not your keys, not your cryoto"

we need to have a public private key pair

1. public key cna be shared to everyone and it can be used to track the balances (solscan.io)
2. private key is a secret string it must not be shared 


private key is just an array of 32 bytes
