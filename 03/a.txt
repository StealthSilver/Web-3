BANKS vs BLOCKCHAINS

in banks after the username and password signin we can 
1. see balance
2. transfer money
3. recieve money

in blockchains if we want to create a wallet:
"not your keys, not your cryoto"

we need to have a public private key pair
with every public key there is an associated private key


1. public key can be shared to everyone and it can be used to track the balances (solscan.io), to recieve the money only public key is required
2. private key is a secret string it must not be shared, for sending money private key is also required


private key is just an array of 32 bytes 
[122, 232, 008, 231..... 32 times] -> (converted into a string)

ENCODING 

every byte from 0 to 255 represents a character

the public keys in solana are stored in base 58 encoding

there are different types of encodings 
1. ASCII
2. HEX (4 bits at a time) [0 ,1, 2 .... A, B ,C ,D ,E ,F] (base 16 encoding)
3. BASE 64 (a-z , A-Z, + , /) (64 characters) (6 characters at a time) 
4.
