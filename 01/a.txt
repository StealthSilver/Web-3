NEED FOR CRYPTO
1. After the barter system. The money is controlled by the govt.
2. The inflation is rising day by day as govt. can't be trusted, we cannot trust currency controlled by a central authority.
3. Banks use fractonal reserve banking and they go down e.g. Silicon Valley Bank

HASHING 
string -> hashing function -> hash (can't be reversed)

1. deterministic
2. fast computition
3. pre-image resistant
4. small chnages correspond to large chnages
5. collision resistant 

JS crypto library

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(input).digest("hex");

sha256 -> hashing algorithm
hex -> encoding (after this the 256 character string will get a 64 character string)

TRANSACTION IN THE BLOCKCHAIN

the bitcoin node aggregates the transactions
the miners find the noance for the transactions (proof of work)
the miners broadcast the transaction on the complete chain
